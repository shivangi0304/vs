In present year our focus is to apply the concepts of Swami Vivekananda in our daily life through some practical activities for an overall IIT-K community as well as to take active part in nation building. In the past years, we have conducted a plethora of events like talks on Vendanta, ancient India, Sanskrit Language and permaculture, special lecture on self-belief exercise and Spoken Sanskrit Language, social Services like Health Camps around the campus. Weekly discussions on Swami Vivekanandaâ€™s life and teachings, Vendata classes, Sanskrit classes, meditation sessions and distribution of Vivekananda literature among youth were also conducted.

      content : "Many people have an unanswered question regarding the purpose of our life. Golden teachings of Vivekananda are the perfect guidelines for a peaceful and spiritual way of living. So it is essential to deliver his messages to the world in an easy way that everyone can understand and follow them. We spread his teachings by creating awareness, motivating people through our weekly discussions, Vedanta class, Sanskrit class.
 The mind is the subtle part of the body and is the control system of the body. Stress is a common problem that disturbs the mental health of a person. It is crucial to fill everyone's mind with positive energy by inducing positive habits that help them to maintain a positive attitude. We conduct meditation classes to ensure that everyone on the campus leads a positive and stress-free lifeWe also motivate students and help them develop soft skills. These leadership qualities help for their overall development and also make their lives productive. We support the poor and needy communities by conducting donation drives, educating their children.

      content : "If the sole purpose of life is enjoying pleasures and having fun, it can be done by animals also. What differentiates humans from animals is their ability to uplift the needy. Present Young minds become the future, so it is essential to mould them in the right shape. They must develop empathy for the poor and help them. We aim at shaping the face of humanity. Spirituality can be a path to self-realisation, which incorporates the feeling of compassion towards others. The novel philosophy of Swami Vivekananda is to nurture and nourish the students to lead an ideal life aiding their overall development. We believe that including spirituality in every work makes it a stress-free task."
