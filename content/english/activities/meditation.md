## Weekly Meditation Sessions

Many times, our efforts in daily life produce subtle results and we are often discouraged to see that there is no outcome. But over time, repeated practice is expected to bear fruits.
"As people associated with intellectual domain, human mind's ability of concentrating the entire attention in a single subject is a key tool at our disposal. However, we often feel that we are not exploiting this tool to the extent possible."

One may notice that with limited time/energy, wasting on millions of unproductive thoughts, it is difficult to achieve great things in a short frame of time. However, if we could reduce the number of thoughts and focus more time/energy on each productive thoughts, we will utilize our mental energy to the fullest."

Meditation can help you achieve this!
Vivekananda Samiti, is organizing Meditation classes every Saturday since 6 years and it has been continuing as for the manifold benefits people are gaining, who are regular in practice and following the guidelines of our Instructor.

Meditation session: Each meditation session is unique in it's way and stimulates different energy centers leading to distinct benefits.

Gita session: After the meditation session, there will be discussion on Gita which will be from the Vedantic standpoint, which is the most practical and relevant to our day-to-day life.

We are privileged to organize these sessions under the guidance of Swami Atmashraddhananda, who is currently the Secretary of Ramakrishna Mission Ashram, Kanpur.

Swami Atmashraddhananda ji joined the Ramakrishna Monastic Order in 1989. He has wide knowledge in Vedanta and was the editor of "Vedanta Kesari", a cultural and spiritual monthly magazine for over a century. For 12 years he was the guide for the Vivekananda Study Circle at IIT Madras where he used to conduct a Sunday class for the Study Circle.

We invite all of you to be part of our on going classes.
