## Lectures and Talks

Discussions help students to think, which allows them to process the information to understand the concepts. We educate students on various issues through our talks and discussion sessions. Lectures are conducted frequently about Vedanta, yoga and its significance, mental health awareness. Speakers from different fields like educational institutes, professional companies and also spiritual field come to interact with the students and help them develop a transparent thought process.
